# KFCA_for_neuraldata
This repository performs  a full analysis of chemosensory responses in C. elegans using K-FCA

This code corresponds to the analysis performed by Emma Reyner-Fuentes, Carmen Pel√°ez-Moreno and Francisco J. Valverde-Albacete for the paper "Cracking the C. elegans Neural Code: A Conceptual Map of Sensory Processing", currently under review in PLOS Computational Biology.

To run this code, you will need the toolboxes "A", "B" and "C" that you can find in [FJValverde's profile](https://github.com/FJValverde).

As for the data, to replicate our analysis you will need to download the data from the paper Lin A, Qin S, Casademunt H, Wu M, Hung W, Cain G, Tan NZ, Valenzuela R, Lesanpezeshki L, Venkatachalam V, Pehlevan C, Zhen M, Samuel ADT. Functional imaging and quantification of multineuronal olfactory responses in C. elegans. Sci Adv. 2023 Mar;9(9):eade1249. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.ade1249. Epub 2023 Mar 1. PMID: 36857454; PMCID: PMC9977185. Their repository is in [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7563053) and the specific data we used is in
