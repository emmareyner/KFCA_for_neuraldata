function [PI,Pxy,MI,Hxy] = pmi(N)
% pointwise mutual information operator [I,Pxy] = pmi(N)
%
% From a count matrix, N, describing the occurrence of joint events of two
% different phenomena, this obtains the pointwise mutual information (I) in bits of
% those events, which is the logarithm (base 2) of the quotiens of the joint
% probability by the marginals. This is considered a maxplus matrix. When N
% is sparse, the result is maxplus sparsely encoded.
% The MLE of the joint probability distribution [Pxy] can also be requested
% 
% The weighted pointwise mutual information (WI) can be easily calculated
% from these, as well as other statistics. Remember that 0*log 0 = 0 by
% convention.
%  WPI = Pxy.*I;
%  WPI(Pxy==0)=0;
% Hence the average mutual information MI is:
%  MI = sum(sum(WPI))
%
% THis works for either sparse of full N matrices.

%Build the contingency matrix, then the MLE estimate of the joint
%probabilites.
%TODO: make a package for contingency matrices(?)

%When nans are generated, some adjustements are required
%Consider Nij=1, Ni=1, Nj=1, Nt -> Inf. The quotient goes to Inf, and the
%counts are indiscernible from as many zeroes. However, when only two of
%the counts go to zero, Nij must vanish more quickly than Ni (or Nj), hence
%the quotient goes to zero.
% FVA: review this!
