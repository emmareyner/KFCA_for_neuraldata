- 24/07/09:
  - Write documentation for packages.
  - finish Trisparse class for representing matrices
  - Write a list of CAVEATS for representation, like don't mix sparse matrices in maxplus and minplus encodings.

  - All layout objects should be subobjects of @GraphViz or maybe a
    subpackage +layout.
  - @network.Graphviz should be a generic class instantiated on classes
    like boolean and mmp.x.Sparse, because the consideration of what
    constitutes and "empty" edge depends on the undelying algebra
    (i.e. 0 or false for boolean matrices, -Inf for mmp.l double
    matrices, 0 for mmp.Sparse matrices, etc.)
