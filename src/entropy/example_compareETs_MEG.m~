%Example of classifier performance comparison based on the Entropy Triangle
%using the script compareETs to visually compare 10 example confusion 
%matrices and to print the NIT and EMA vs. other measures in latex-ready 
%format.

%The Normalized Information Transfer (NIT) rate, and the Entropy-Modified 
%Accuracy (EMA) are improvements to accuracy to measure how good your 
%multiclass classifiers are whose rationale and definition can be found in
