function blah = labels (varargin)

%LABELS  user-defined class to deal with labels for phone manipulation, 
%        especially in the context of classes PHONMAT and CONFMAT.
%
%	Their use is best explained by example. Supposed you have an
%	experiment with the English phones /t/, /d/, /th/ and /dh/.
%	For convenience, define 1-character labels (called ONELABELS)
%	for each, say t,d,T and D. This is the approach followed by
%	the DISC format in CELEX for example. You would still like to
%	remember that T stands for /th/ of course.
%
%	blah = labels ('tdTD','T th D dh');
%	blah{'th'}  --> 'T'  
%	blah('th')  --> 3    (position in original string definition)
%	blah{'D'}   --> 'D'
%	blah('D')   --> 4
%	blah{'dh'}  --> 'D'
%	blah{'zh'}  --> ''
%	blah('zh')  --> 0
%       blah.phones --> 'tdTD'
%       blah.allphones  --> 't d T (th) D (dh)'
%
%       The second argument in the initialization is optional. If you have
%       no labels other than your onelabels, "blah = labels('tdTD')" is ok.
%
%	At the moment there is no functionality to modify or delete labels as 
%	I have not needed it. Feel free to add and even freer to email
%	me and tell me about your improved version.
%
%	It is your responsibility to make sure that labels don't contradict
%	each other. Saying addlabels (blah, 'T th D th') is definitely a 
%       "Bad command! Go sit in the corner" kind of thing.
